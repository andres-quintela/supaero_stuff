/**
 * @file bst-map.h
 *
 * @brief Simple definition of BST containing map values
 *
 * @author Christophe Garion
 *
 * This is a simple definition of a binary search tree containing `int`
 * values implemented using nodes linked by pointers. Warning: the cells
 * pointers should not be shared as deallocation of a BST
 * deallocates the memory space reserved for the cells!
 *
 * The API of the BST is defined as follows:
 *
 * - a function to create an empty BST
 * - a function to check is the BST is empty
 * - a function to get the value at the root of the BST
 * - a function to get the size of the BST
 * - a function to get the height of the BST
 * - a function to get the left child of the BST
 * - a function to get the right child of the BST
 * - a function to retrieve a value in the BST
 * - a function to insert a value in the BST
 * - a function to delete a value in the BST
 * - a function to insert a value in the BST (AVL)
 * - a function to delete a value in the BST (AVL)
 * - a function to print the nodes values in-order
 * - a function to deallocate the BST
 * - a function to print the BST
