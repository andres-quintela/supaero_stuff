Question 1
-----------------
 - Starting from quickstart.py, implements an algorithm that finds
   the value of the best production plan of the thermal plant
    The plan should satisfy the following  :
        - the plant can be either Off or On at its maximal power
        - the electricity produced is sold at the prices given in the data_file
        - the production cost consists of a cost proportionnal to the amount of energy produced
    """

Question 2
--------------
 - Now enhance the code to find the optimal production plan, and plot it.
 - Make some tests to ensure that the production plan you obtained is indeed optimal

Question 3
--------------
  - Take the startup cost into account
  - Take a quadratic cost into account
  - Make some tests

Question 4
---------------
   - Take into account maximal increase and decrease rates
   - Make some tests

Question 5
--------------
   - Take into account a maximal number of statups
   - Make some tests

Question 6
------------------
  - Take into account a minimum online duration
  - Make some tests
